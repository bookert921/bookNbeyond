# Book and Beyond

This is the repo for my personal, portfolio website. I originally decided to call it Book and Beyond because I had a vision of where I was before seriously pursing software engineering, and saw how far I've come since. Book and Beyond is meant to express my own growth but it is also meant to inspire. After all, It's about taking yourself to the next level. This is just a window towards my achievements. And together with my blog (currently under construction), I hope to be an active leader towards success in this rapidly changing field.

It's been a challenging road so far, learning how to become more pragmatic in my thinking, understanding how design patterns, data structures, algorithms and such come into play for even better code and performance optimization, and overall just trying to keep up with the evolving technologies.

Lastly, I have made the code to my personal portfolio public so that others can see what technologies I'm using and it's evolving over time. In addition, I leave it to you to take from it what you need. I'm on the side of open-source and freely distrubuted information ;). I do hope you enjoy. And thank you for visiting my website!
