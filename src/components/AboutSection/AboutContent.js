    description: "I began my software career as a Software Tester for e-commerce web applications. Over time, I found myself wanting to fix more of the issues and wanting to solve more complex problems. Seeing how overwhelmed some of the developers were on my team, I sought out oppertunities to learn what I could about website development to better aid my developer companions. What began as a mere allowance to fix typos in the HTML, soon became CSS fixed, and eventually I found myself stumbling into JavaScript. By learning through baby steps, I feel that I've developed a strong foundation and a more keen sense of what a user wants to see and how I, now as a developer, can make that happen with fewer errors and a more pleasant experience.",
